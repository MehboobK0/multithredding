    "Multithreading in Python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single process. It allows multiple tasks to be executed concurrently, thereby improving the efficiency of the program by utilizing the CPU effectively. Multithreading is used to perform tasks that can be executed independently and concurrently, such as I/O-bound operations, network communication, and parallel processing. The module used to handle threads in Python is called the threading module. The threading module provides a high-level interface for working with threads in Python. It is used because it simplifies the creation, management, and synchronization of threads, allowing developers to easily implement multithreaded programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The threading module in Python provides several functions to work with threads:\n",
    "\n",
    "activeCount(): This function returns the number of active threads currently running.\n",
    "currentThread(): This function returns the current Thread object.\n",
    "enumerate(): This function returns a list of all Thread objects currently active.\n",
    "Explanation of the following functions in the context of the Thread class:\n",
    "run(): This method defines the code that will be executed by the thread when it starts running.\n",
    "start(): This method starts the execution of the thread by invoking the run() method.\n",
    "join(): This method blocks the calling thread until the thread on which it is called completes its execution.\n",
    "isAlive(): This method returns a boolean value indicating whether the thread is currently executing."

    "Advantages of multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved performance and responsiveness: Multithreading allows tasks to be executed concurrently, making better use of available CPU resources and improving the responsiveness of the application.\n",
    "Simplified programming model: Multithreading simplifies the development of concurrent programs by allowing tasks to be implemented as separate threads, making it easier to manage and coordinate multiple tasks within a single process.\n",
    "Disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased complexity: Multithreading introduces complexity in program design and debugging, as developers need to consider issues such as race conditions, deadlocks, and synchronization.\n",
    "Potential for resource contention: Multithreading can lead to resource contention issues when multiple threads access shared resources concurrently, potentially causing performance bottlenecks and unpredictable behavior.\n",
    "Deadlocks and race conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlock: A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources that they need to proceed. Deadlocks typically occur when multiple threads acquire locks in different orders, leading to a circular dependency where each thread holds a lock that another thread needs.\n",
    "Race condition: A race condition occurs when the outcome of a program depends on the relative timing or interleaving of operations performed by multiple threads. Race conditions can lead to unpredictable behavior and incorrect results, especially when multiple threads access shared resources without proper synchronization."
